@questions: do we have to necessarily push r4-r11? 
@what if I'm storing the updated value in stack in registor r0-r3?

binary_search_ARM:
    @ We need to save away a bunch of registers
    push    {r4-r11, ip, lr}
    @ May need to decrement stack pointer for more stack space    
    SUB sp, sp, #8 @it has to decrement one line as 8 bytes but we will only use mid in this case
    
    SUB r6, r3, r2 @end - start
    LSR r6 @half of r6
    ADD r6, r2, r6 @mid = (end - start)/2 + start
    STR r6, [sp] @stack pointer is now storing the new value of mid
    
    CMP r3, r2
    BLE return_one
    
    LDR r7, [r0, r6] @data[mid]
    CMP r7, r1
    BEQ return_mid
    
    BLE loop_right
    BGT loop_left
    
    B end
    
loop_right:   
    SUB r6, r6 ,#1
    MOV r3, r6
    BL binary_search_ARM

loop_left:
    ADD r6, r6, #1
    MOV r2, r6
    BL binary_search_ARM

return_mid:
    MOV r0, r6
    
return_one:
    MOV r0, #-1
    
end:ADD sp, sp, #8
    @ Remember to restore the stack pointer before popping!
    @ This handles restoring registers and returning
    pop     {r4-r11, ip, pc}
